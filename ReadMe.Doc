First of all, I would like to thank you for considering me for this opportunity and for giving me a chance to explore my ability beyond my skills.
It was a great learning experience for me to complete this task. Though I had a java coding background still it was challenging as I had no idea about what espresso is, how to deal with the test classes in espresso and build and deploy over CircleCI was completely new to me.
 
Since, to attempt this challenge, I had to go through some research and learning to check how deep I need to dig and how minimum knowledge I would require to complete this task. 
So I started with reading about espresso, CircleCI, writing test classes, started with a small dummy project to check if I am ready. Sometimes I ended my whole night watching all the learning videos just to make myself comfortable. Though this much research might not be required to attempt this however slowly and gradually I found myself being so serious about this task and made myself clear to complete it. 

Once I was ready, I started to dig into the source code to list out what all classes/ methods would require to include in my testing according to the given tasks.

Once I get a complete overview I came up with a few suggestions also that I have mentioned in the document under the Application enhancement section. Please go through with that You can find the document link as below.

Once got myself cleared with the testing approach I finally I reached to my important role which is Testing. Rolled up through all the corners of the source code and listed down all the possible test scenarios that we can include to test a particular task. However, I wrote test classes for ones that were important to cover the given particular task. Please go the complete document where I have mentioned all the possible test scenarios for each task.
 
Now, I was ready with my test approach and plan listing all the test scenarios. Now had to think about my execution plan to meet my delivery schedule. I choose all the important test scenarios which will cover all my tasks, written test classes for each one of them, compiled and executed once in my Android studio.
 
Once finished with all these, one more learning was waiting for me that made me work all the time I had left after my office hours. The task was to build and deploy over Circle CI.
 
It took me a while to understand the prerequisite to build a particular project over CircleCI. I went through all the available docs over google, YouTube and spoke to some of my friends as well who work as a freelance on Github. Then got to know that Config.yml file is all about that I need to have to finish this.
 
In short, the whole learning experience was great and it allowed me to get an idea of how far I can push myself to get the job done by myself. 
 
Thank you again for this opportunity.

Now please take a look at below section where I have mentioned all the details about how I attempted the task.

1.For Task 1- Created one test class name as “AuthenticationActivityTest.java” that consists total three test methods (testSuccessfulLOGIN(), testLOGIN_InvalidPassword(), testLOGIN_BlankUserPassword()) written for three different scenarios.

Test class can be found at below location.

2.For Task 2- Created one test class “DriverProFileActivityTest.java” that consists one test method as “searchDriver()” to test the given task activity.
Test class can be found at below location.

3.For Task 3- This one made my head vibrate like anything. I was feeling like I am on a mission and the mission was getting more serious every time I executed the build job and it got failed. However, the mission accomplished. Please find below the links for Github and CircleCI page.
